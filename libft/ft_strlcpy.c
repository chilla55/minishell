/*
** The strcpy() function copies the string pointed to by src,
** including the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the buffer pointed
** to by dest.  The strings may not overlap, and the destination
** string dest must be large enough to receive the copy.  Beware of
** buffer overruns!  (See BUGS.)
**
** The strncpy() function is similar, except that at most n bytes of
** src are copied.  Warning: If there is no null byte among the
** first n bytes of src, the string placed in dest will not be null-
** terminated.
** If the length of src is less than n, strncpy() writes additional
** null bytes to dest to ensure that a total of n bytes are written.
** strlcpy() is similar to strncpy(), but it copies at most
** size-1 bytes to dest, always adds a terminating null byte, and
** does not pad the destination with (further) null bytes.  This
** function fixes some of the problems of strcpy() and strncpy(),
** but the caller must still handle the possibility of data loss if
** size is too small.  The return value of the function is the
** length of src, which allows truncation to be easily detected: if
** the return value is greater than or equal to size, truncation
** occurred.  If loss of data matters, the caller must either check
** the arguments before the call, or test the function return value.
** strlcpy() is not present in glibc and is not standardized by
** POSIX, but is available on Linux via the libbsd library.
